# Project3WebScrapedDataAnalysis
 
 
## The goal of this project was looking at Super Bowl score data to
## determine which spots in the classic 10 x 10 Super Bowl gambling boxes
## tend to pay out winners more.

## To do so, we scraped data from a website containing quarterly score figures by making html requests, organized/structured the data, and plotted some of our conclusions in seaborn library's charting capabilities.

## It turns out that certain Super Bowl boxes have paid out more frequently than others.
## I also looked into a few other questions about the score data from each quarter.
